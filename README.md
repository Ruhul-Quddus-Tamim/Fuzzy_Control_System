# Fuzzy_Control_System

Fuzzy Control Systems: Dishwasher Appliance
The ‘Diswasher problem’ is used to illustrate the power of fuzzy logic principles to generate complex behavior from a compact, intuitive set of expert rules. The conventional method required the human interruption to decide upon what should be the processing time for the different dish conditions. In other words, analysis and decision-making ability have been incorporated to the machine which makes the machine much more intelligent. 

Proposed System using Mamdani model of FIS – Dishwasher Appliance
A fuzzy control system is created to model how long will it take to calculate the washing time depending on the number of plates and the level of dirtiness.

This problem is formulated as:

    Antecednets (Inputs)
           Number of plates
    • Universe (ie, plates value range): Number of plates, on a scale of 0 to 50?
    • Fuzzy set: LOW, AVERAGE, HIGH, EXTRA HIGH

            Level of dirtiness
    • Universe: How dirty the plates are on a scale of 0 to 100?
    • Fuzzy set: : LIGHT, MEDIUM, HEAVY, VERY HEAVY

    Consequents (Outputs)
 Wash Time
    • Universe: How much will it take to wash ll the plates are measured on a scale of 0 to 90 minutes
    • Fuzzy set:  SHORT, AVERAGE, LONG
